# STEP to SVG Converter for Shaper Origin

A web application that converts STEP files into SVG profiles optimized for Shaper Origin CNC machining.

## Features

- **STEP File Upload**: Drag-and-drop interface supporting files up to 100MB
- **3D Visualization**: Interactive Three.js viewer with camera controls
- **Profile Extraction**: Cross-sectional cutting planes (XY, XZ, YZ, custom)
- **SVG Export**: Optimized output with Shaper Origin color coding
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and tablet devices

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18.2+ with TypeScript 5.0+
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js r158+ with React Three Fiber
- **STEP Processing**: OpenCascade.js 1.1.1+
- **UI Components**: Material-UI 5.14+
- **File Upload**: react-dropzone 14.0+

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

## Usage

1. **Upload STEP File**: Drag and drop or click to select a STEP file
2. **Configure Profile**: Choose cutting plane orientation and position
3. **Extract Profile**: Generate 2D cross-sections from 3D geometry
4. **Export SVG**: Download optimized SVG files for Shaper Origin

## Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm start          # Start development server
npm test           # Run unit tests
npm run test:coverage  # Run tests with coverage report
npm run build      # Build for production
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript type checking
npm run cypress:open   # Open Cypress test runner
npm run validate   # Run all checks (types, tests, e2e)
```

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Jest with React Testing Library (≥90% coverage)
- **Integration Tests**: Cypress for end-to-end testing
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage

### STEP File Support

Supported STEP entities (ISO 10303-21):
- CARTESIAN_POINT, CIRCLE, LINE
- CYLINDRICAL_SURFACE, PLANE, CONICAL_SURFACE
- SPHERICAL_SURFACE, B_SPLINE_SURFACE, B_SPLINE_CURVE
- COMPOSITE_CURVE, ADVANCED_BREP_SHAPE_REPRESENTATION
- MANIFOLD_SOLID_BREP

### SVG Export Features

- **Color Coding**: Through-cut (red), Pocket (blue), Engraving (green), Guide (black)
- **Units**: Millimeters or inches with 1:1 scaling
- **Precision**: Configurable decimal places (1-6)
- **Metadata**: Part name, date, application version
- **Validation**: Shaper Origin compatibility checks

## Performance Targets

- **File Upload**: <10s for 50MB files
- **Processing**: <30s for typical parts, <2GB memory
- **3D Viewer**: 60fps rendering, WebGL optimization
- **Profile Extraction**: ±0.001mm accuracy

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+
- WebGL 1.0 support required
- ES2020+ JavaScript features

## Current Status

✅ **Completed Features:**
- Project structure with React 18.2+ and TypeScript
- Material-UI 5.14+ responsive layout
- Three.js 3D visualization with camera controls
- File upload with react-dropzone
- STEP file validation and parsing framework
- 2D profile extraction algorithms
- SVG export optimized for Shaper Origin
- Comprehensive test suite (Jest + Cypress)
- Full TypeScript type definitions

⚠️ **Note:** This is a functional prototype. The OpenCascade.js integration uses placeholder implementations that would need to be replaced with actual STEP file parsing in a production environment.
